  - cors handler package
  - serverless offline replacement dev environment
  - Makefile doesn't work in its current state on Windows
- #### SERVERLESS JS
  - deploy fails sometimes and says too many files open
  - what?
- #### TERRAFORM
  - can't get DNS records to deploy properly
  - have to set up domains and certs manually
- #### GENERALLY
  - add recap for current state of project for when I come back and don't know what's going on
  - identify and document all manual steps
