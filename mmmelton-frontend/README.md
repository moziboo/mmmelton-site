### progress

- 08-17-2024-01 made blog feed with cards but need to figure out vertical sizing with truncated descriptions
- 08-18-2024-01 created another dynamo table for the purpose of holding user info, blog poasts, galleries, and media items
- 08-19-2024-01 I'm realizing now this probably needs to go in the root of the repo
- 08-19-2024-02 worked on hosting the site locally and making it publically accessible.
    it shows up @ http://134.215.29.127/ but TDS said it will change
